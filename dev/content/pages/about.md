I am a postdoc at Harvard's [IQSS][] and Northeastern's [Network Science Institute][], and a member of the [Lazer Lab][]. I got my PhD in the [Computer Science][] from Cornell, where I was advised by [Mor Naaman][] as part of the Jacobs Institute at [Cornell Tech][]. I was fortunate enough to spend time at [Facebook Core Data Science][], [Yahoo Labs][], [SocialFlow Inc.][] and [Bloomberg L.P.][] Prior to Cornell, I got MS in Computer Science from Rutgers University and a double major B.Sc. in Physics and Computer Science at Tel-Aviv University.

In my research I combine machine learning, natural language processing and statistical methods to learn about human behavior in the real-world using large-scale datasets. My dissertation focused on developing computational methods for studying individuals' attention online, for example to attention to online news or to social media. See the [publications][] page for a complete list of works where I managed to [push the limit][] a little bit through my work.
