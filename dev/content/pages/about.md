I am a PhD candidate in the [Computer Science][] department at Cornell
University and part of the Jacobs Institute at [Cornell Tech][]. My advisor is [Mor Naaman][] and I am
a member of the great [Social Technologies Lab][]. I was fortunate to spend the
past summers as a research intern at [Facebook Core Data Science][], [Yahoo Labs][], [SocialFlow
Inc.][] and [Bloomberg L.P.][] Prior to Cornell, I got MS in Computer
Science from Rutgers University and a double major B.Sc. in Physics and
Computer Science at Tel-Aviv University.

My research interests are in the intersection of Social Media, Machine
learning, Language and Statistics. In particular, I use statistical
models and algorithms to learn about human behavior in the real-world
from large-scale datasets. See the [publications][] page for a complete
list of works where I managed to [push the limit][] a little bit in
answering these questions.
